# Draft of microcode spec

This microcode should be executed by the CGRA microcontroler unit.
The unit should be capable of responding to the master
interface when instructions such as the query set are executed. 

(attempt at making a 20-bit microcode spec)

             | set | encode fmt | inst | fields?       |
core format: | xxx | x          | xxx  | xxxxxxxxxxxxx |

			 | set | encode fmt | inst | op1           |
one operand: | xxx | x          | xxx  | xxxxxxxxxxxxx |

			 | set | encode fmt | inst | op1      | op2      |
two operand: | xxx | x          | xxx  | xxxxxxxx | xxxxxxxx |

			 | set | encode fmt | inst | op1      | imm      |
one op imm:  | xxx | x          | xxx  | xxxxxxxx | xxxxxxxx |
	- imm should be index to memory of constants

encode fmt bit: differentiates between field splits

### Base

#### Description
- This set includes
	- Timestep setting (setting the number of timesteps, and which timestep is active)
	- Connection setting
	- Context saving/loading
	- Set iteration bound
	- Set constant into constant memory
	- (advanced: Set iteration exit condition based on PE result)

           | set | encode | inst | fields?  |
base.fmt1: | 000 | 0      | xxx  |          |

##### Set Timestep
"ts t",                  | 000 | 1 | 000 | <t>               |

##### Set Connection
"setc <source>, <sink>", | 000 | 0 | 001 | <source> | <sink> |

Source and sink are 8 bits each. First 7 bits are the PEs absolute ID,
counted from top left, right-wards first, and down row by row, 
and last bit is port index (2 ports max).

Using 7 bits, a CGRA of max size 128 is possible (9x9).
Note that this means that the same encoding for a PE can lead to different
physical x,y locations depending on grid size!

In a 8x8 mesh, Source and sink can be represented by mnemonics such as:
PE14.Port0 --> 0001100.0 --> PE number 12 is at coordinate x = 1, y = 4
PE00.Port1 --> 0000000.1

##### Context Save/Load
"svctx <slot>",          | 000 | 1 | 010 | <slot>               |
"ldctx <slot>",          | 000 | 1 | 011 | <slot>               |

Saves/loads the current connection settings into a context memory page.
The context memory is a single cycle (?) page switch where every connection is defined.

The mesh is configured based on the connection info the the "front buffer". 
The front buffer can be entirely replaced by a ldctx, or saved into a backpage by a svctx.
The front buffer is editable after a ldctx by using "setc".

### Query

- This set includes
	- Query PE type
	- Query current driver of port
	- Query CGRA size
	- Query CGRA ISA features (i.e., which sets are implemented)
	- Query context memory?
