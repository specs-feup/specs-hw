# Tree Coordinate System for Mesh in CGRA

To pick any PE in a CGRA, the number of required bits is only as
high as the max(width, height) of the mesh, rounded up to an even number.

The mnemonic syntax for PE coordinates in the microcode is:

"PE<Nr>.Port<N>", where Nr is up to two digits
e.g. PE04.Port0 --> where x= 0 and y = 4, encoding is "1010.0"

Encoding Example:
For a mesh that is 4x4, PE04 can be encoded with "1010.0", where the PE field is read right to left.

Each bit read chooses half of the CGRA, starting by a horizontal split, then a vertical, etc.
Zero is left/up, 1 is right/down. A sequence of choices encodes an individual PE.
For CGRAs with odd numbers of PEs in any dimension, the choice is made assuming a virtual (non existent) 
row/column of PEs which cannot be addressed. 

Another example:
For a mesh that is 6x5, PE32 can be chosen by encoding: "001100"
Meaning, starting from the mesh center: 
left from center, 
up (on the resulting 3x(5+1) submesh), 
right (on the resulting 3x3(+1) submesh), 
down (on the resulting 1x3(+1) submesh), 
left (on the resulting 1(+1)x1(+1) submesh),
up (on the resulting 1(+1)x1 submesh)

Mesh:
         _ _ _ _ _ _
         |x x x x x x|
         |x x x x x x|
y = 2 -> |x x o x x x|
         |x x x x x x|
         |x x x x x x|
