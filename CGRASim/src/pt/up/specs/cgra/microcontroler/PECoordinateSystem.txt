# Tree Coordinate System for Mesh in CGRA

To pick any PE in a CGRA, the number of required bits is only as
high as the max(width, height) of the mesh, rounded up to an even number.

The mnemonic syntax for PE coordinates in the microcode is:

"PE<Nr>.Port<N>", where Nr is up to two digits
e.g. PE04.Port0 --> where x= 0 and y = 4, encoding is "0101.0"

Encoding Example:
For a mesh that is 4x4, PE04 can be encoded with
